ABOUT:
I made this script for myself. I had a bunch of files in different folders. They came from different sources but the naming of the files were just timestamps of 
when the files was made. I wanted to rename each file to know where the source was. So I made a script to append a word to the front of all the files in a directory.
So it would add the source to the front and keep the timestamp after. 

After I used the script for myself. I decided to add some logic to be able to use it easily in the future for any similiar type needs.

HOW TO USE:
After you download and run the script it will then prompt you for the directory or path to the files needed to be renamed. 
Once you provide the directory it will then print all the files in that directory so you can confirm if it was the correct directory.
It will prompt asking if it was correct or needs to be updated before continuing.

The next prompt will be to add any text you want to append to the beginning of a file name. 
It will then display an example using the first file name it displayed earlier. 
Below the displayed example it will then prompt if that looks good or if you want to make any changes to what it appends.

Once you confirm everything is good, I made the script verbose so you're able to see the files getting renamed and when it's finished.
