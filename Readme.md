# Script for Appending Prefix to File Names

## About

I created this script to make it easier to rename a bunch of files in different folders. The files came from different sources but had the same naming convention - a timestamp of when the file was made. I wanted to rename each file with a prefix to indicate the source, while keeping the original timestamp.

## How to Use

1. Download the script and run it.
2. When prompted, enter the directory or path to the files that need to be renamed.
3. The script will then print all the files in that directory, so you can confirm that it is the correct directory. If it is incorrect, you can update the path.
4. Next, enter the text you want to append to the beginning of each file name.
5. The script will display an example of what the new file name will look like using the first file in the directory.
6. You can confirm if the new name looks good or make changes as needed.
7. The script will then begin renaming the files, and you will see a verbose output of the progress.
8. Once it finishes, you will see a message indicating that it is complete.

## Notes

- This script was created for personal use, but I added some logic to make it more versatile for future use.
- The script is designed to keep the original timestamp intact, while adding a prefix to the file name.
